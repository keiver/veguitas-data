Not Promises.</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed opacity-95\">\n      Look, we both know why you're here. The apagones aren't getting better—they're getting longer. And your tía is tired of losing everything in the fridge while the government figures out what century it wants to live in. Solar isn't a luxury anymore. It's survival infrastructure. The question isn't <em>if</em> you should send panels to Cuba—it's which ones will actually work when they get there, survive the humidity, and generate enough juice to keep the essentials running during those 8, 10, 12-hour blackouts.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-10\">\n    <p>\n      Here's what nobody tells you about sending solar panels to Cuba: <strong>portability matters more than raw wattage</strong>. Why? Because customs is unpredictable, shipping costs are calculated by dimensional weight, and your family might need to move the setup between apartments or even provinces. A 400W foldable panel that fits in a suitcase beats a rigid 600W monster that costs $300 to ship and might get \"inspected\" into oblivion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The other thing—and I cannot stress this enough—is that <strong>you need a complete system, not just panels</strong>. Panels without a charge controller are paperweights. Panels without a battery bank are daytime-only solutions. Some of the kits below include everything; others assume you're piecing it together. I'll be clear about which is which.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One more reality check: Cuban electrical infrastructure runs on 110V/220V depending on the neighborhood and the mood of the grid. Most of these panels output 12V or 24V DC, which means you'll need an inverter to run household appliances. Some kits include them. Most don't. Budget accordingly.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"bg-sunglow/10 border-2 border-sunglow p-5 md:p-8 rounded-xl mb-10\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-raisin dark:text-white mb-3\">The Short Version</h3>\n    <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 text-base md:text-lg mb-4\">\n      If you want the best balance of power, portability, and Cuba-proof durability, the <strong>Renogy 400W Portable Solar Panel Suitcase</strong> is the one. IP67 waterproof, folds into a manageable package, and has kickstands that actually work. It's not cheap, but it's the panel your family will still be using five years from now.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4LMVKYD?tag=veguitas-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">\n      See the Renogy 400W Suitcase →\n    </a>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <div class=\"text-center my-10\">\n    <span class=\"text-5xl md:text-6xl font-extrabold text-flame\">8-12</span>\n    <p class=\"text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2\">Average blackout hours in Cuban provinces (2025 data)</p>\n  </div>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-raisin dark:text-white mb-6\">The One to Beat</h2>\n    \n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-5 md:p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-xl mb-8 ring-2 ring-lime ring-offset-2 dark:ring-offset-slate-900\">\n      <span class=\"bg-lime text-raisin px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-bold uppercase mb-4 inline-block\">Editor's Pick</span>\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-64 shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610YOlNH9pL._AC_UY218_.jpg\" alt=\"Renogy 400W Portable Solar Panel Suitcase - Editor's Pick for Cuba\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"rounded-xl w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\">\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-raisin dark:text-white mb-2\" data-asin=\"B0D4LMVKYD\">Renogy 400W Portable Solar Panel Suitcase</h3>\n          <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center gap-3 mb-4\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.4★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$$$$$ tier</span>\n          </div>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">\n            <strong>VERDICT: The gold standard for Cuba-bound solar.</strong> This thing is built like it expects to be dropped, dragged through customs, and set up on a rooftop in Holguín. IP67 waterproof means it laughs at tropical storms. The suitcase design with sturdy kickstands means your family doesn't need engineering degrees to set it up. 23% efficiency isn't the absolute highest, but it's consistent and reliable.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm mb-4\">\n            The catch? You'll need a charge controller and battery bank separately.

It's portable enough to survive customs and apartment moves, powerful enough to matter during 8+ hour blackouts, and built to handle tropical humidity. Pair it with a charge controller and battery bank, and your family has genuine energy independence.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"text-slate-300 mb-6\">\n      If budget is tight, start with the <strong class=\"text-white\">DOKIO 100W</strong> at the $$$ tier—it's the only mid-range option here and a solid proof-of-concept before scaling up. And if your family owns their home and has roof space? The <strong class=\"text-white\">ECO-WORTHY complete system</strong> is a one-time investment that pays for itself in peace of mind.\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"flex flex-wrap gap-4\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D4LMVKYD?tag=veguitas-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-sunglow text-raisin font-bold no-underline hover:bg-sunglow/90 transition-colors\">\n        Get the Renogy 400W Suitcase →\n      </a>\n      <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NVJLLZ5?tag=veguitas-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-white/20 text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-white/30 transition-colors\">\n        Budget Option: DOKIO 100W →\n      </a>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"mt-10\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-raisin dark:text-white mb-4\">Your Solar Shipping Checklist</h3>\n    <checklist-builder>\n  </checklist-builder></section>\n\n</article>",
