Between dengue outbreaks making headlines and the everyday reality of getting eaten alive during los apagones when you can't even run a fan—your family needs serious protection. Not the watered-down stuff from the pharmacy shelf. The real deal, in quantities that'll actually last.</p>\n</header>\n\n<section class=\"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-8\">\n<p>Here's what most people don't realize when shopping for repellent to ship: there are fundamentally different approaches here. You've got DEET (the nuclear option—works everywhere on everything), Picaridin (gentler, no plastic-melting issues), Permethrin (treats clothes and gear, not skin), and plant-based options for the chemical-averse. Each has a place depending on who's using it and how.</p>\n\n<p>The Cuban climate makes this trickier than buying for yourself in Miami. Humidity degrades some formulas faster. Sweat washes off others before they've done their job. And your tía who refuses to use \"esas cosas químicas\" needs something she'll actually apply. So let's break this down by what actually works, what ships well in bulk, and what won't get your package flagged at customs.</p>\n\n<p>Pro tip before we dive in: aerosol cans are technically restricted in some shipping scenarios. Pump sprays and lotions? Zero issues. Keep that in mind as you build your care package.</p>\n</section>\n\n<div class=\"bg-sunglow/10 border-2 border-sunglow p-6 rounded-xl my-8\">\n<h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mt-0 mb-2\">The Quick Answer</h2>\n<p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">For serious mosquito country—and Cuba qualifies—the <strong>Sawyer Permethrin 24oz</strong> for treating clothes combined with <strong>Repel 100</strong> for exposed skin is unbeatable. Treat clothes once, protection lasts through 6 washes. Your family will thank you during every dusk-to-dawn mosquito assault.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANQVYU?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">See Sawyer Permethrin on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n\n<section class=\"mb-12\">\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">The Heavy Hitters: Maximum DEET Protection</h2>\n\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n<div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LXfxfWwyL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel 100 Insect Repellent 4oz Pump Spray - Best mosquito protection for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-grow\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B004H89KFC\">Repel 100 Insect Repellent, 4oz Pump</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.6★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">This is 98% DEET. Not 25%, not 40%—ninety-eight percent. The kind of concentration you need when mosquitoes have developed PhDs in finding exposed ankles. Ten-hour protection means one application covers an entire evening outdoors. The pump spray won't get confiscated like aerosols might, and 4 ounces is substantial enough to last weeks with normal use.</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">One caveat: DEET at this concentration can damage plastics, synthetic fabrics, and watch crystals. Keep it away from gear. Apply to skin only, and wash hands before touching anything you care about.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\">VERDICT: The \"I refuse to get bitten\" option. Worth every penny for anyone spending time outdoors after dark.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H89KFC?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n<div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HAn5L7DpL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel 100 Travel Size 1oz - Compact mosquito repellent for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-grow\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B000LGN3Z2\">Repel 100 Travel Size, 1oz</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.6★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Same 98% DEET formula, pocket-sized. Perfect for distributing—send a few bottles so everyone in the house has their own. Fits in a purse, work bag, or guayabera pocket. Your cousin who takes the guagua to work? This saves them from that daily mosquito gauntlet at the bus stop.</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">At the $ tier, you can buy several without breaking the bank. The small size also means customs won't look twice.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\">VERDICT: Buy a bunch. Scatter them across the package. Everyone gets protected.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LGN3Z2?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n<div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mXT4opT0L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Ben's 100 DEET 2-Pack - Alcohol-free mosquito repellent\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-grow\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B0738NCJMH\">Ben's 100 DEET, 3.4oz 2-Pack</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.5★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Here's the thing about Ben's that Repel doesn't advertise: it's alcohol-free. Why does that matter in Cuba? Because high-DEET + alcohol + tropical sun = irritated skin that makes you not want to reapply. Ben's water-based formula goes on gentler, especially important for anyone with sensitive skin or who's out in direct sun all day.</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">The 2-pack at $$ means you're getting solid value for two 3.4oz bottles. Same 10-hour protection as Repel 100.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\">VERDICT: The upgrade for anyone who found DEET too harsh. Same protection, gentler delivery.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0738NCJMH?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-12\">\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">The Smart Play: Permethrin for Clothes & Gear</h2>\n\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-6\">This is the secret weapon most people overlook. Permethrin doesn't go on skin—it treats clothing, mosquito nets, hammocks, even curtains. Spray it on, let it dry, and the treatment lasts through six washes. Mosquitoes that land on treated fabric? Dead in seconds. Combine this with skin repellent and you've built an actual fortress.</p>\n\n<div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8\">\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BgXKIOvzL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Permethrin 24oz - Clothing treatment for mosquito protection\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700 mb-4\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B001ANQVYU\">Sawyer Permethrin 24oz</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.6★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 text-sm mb-3\">The sweet spot for families. 24 ounces treats multiple outfits plus a mosquito net. This is enough for a household to treat their most-worn clothes and still have some left over. At the $$ tier, it's genuinely excellent value considering how long one treatment lasts.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white text-sm\">VERDICT: Best balance of quantity and cost. Our top pick for sending to Cuba.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANQVYU?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-3 inline-block px-5 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors text-sm\">Check Price</a>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-sPgzpE7L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Permethrin 9oz - Single bottle clothing treatment\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700 mb-4\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B001ANQVZE\">Sawyer Permethrin 9oz</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.6★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 text-sm mb-3\">Smaller bottle, same formula.

Lighter for shipping too.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white text-sm\">VERDICT: Budget-friendly entry point.

At $$$ you're paying a premium versus buying singles, but you're also saving on shipping weight per ounce.</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">If your family is large or spread across multiple houses, this is the move. Split between households and everyone stays protected for months.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\">VERDICT: The \"I want my whole family covered through mosquito season\" option.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CD9NFB4?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n\n<section class=\"mb-12\">\n<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">The Gentle Alternative: Picaridin Options</h2>\n\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-6\">Not everyone wants to bathe in DEET. Picaridin offers comparable protection without the plastic-melting properties or harsh chemical smell. It's what the CDC recommends as an alternative, and it won't destroy your sunglasses if you accidentally touch your face. Great for kids, for anyone with sensitive skin, or for people who just don't like how DEET feels.</p>\n\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n<div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nf8TQw98L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Picaridin Lotion 4oz - Gentle mosquito repellent\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"flex-grow\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B00VV5KRD8\">Sawyer Picaridin Lotion, 4oz</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.5★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Lotion format means precise application and zero waste from overspray. 20% Picaridin gives you 12+ hours of protection—actually longer than DEET in some conditions. It absorbs cleanly, doesn't leave that oily residue, and you can apply it like regular lotion without worrying about your watch band or phone case.</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Particularly good for the older folks in the family who might find spray formats annoying or wasteful.</p>\n<p class=\"font-semibold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\">VERDICT: Best for abuela and anyone who hates that \"repellent feeling.\"</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VV5KRD8?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8\">\n<div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg\">\n<img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z+P7a34UL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Picaridin Spray 2-Pack 3oz - Pump spray repellent\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700 mb-4\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n<h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white m-0\" data-asin=\"B07BSM6WTY\">Sawyer Picaridin Spray 2-Pack (3oz each)</h3>\n<span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.5★</span>\n</div>\n<p class=\"text-flame font-semibold mb-2\">$$</p>\n<p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 text-sm mb-3\">Pump spray format in a convenient 2-pack.
