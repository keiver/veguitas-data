They're aggressive, they're relentless, and they don't care about your plans. Your family needs real protection—not the watered-down stuff that barely works in air-conditioned Miami. This guide breaks down what's worth the shipping weight and what'll actually survive the humidity.</p>\n  </header>\n\n  <section class=\"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-8\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4\">Why This Matters More Than You Think</h2>\n    <p>Mosquito-borne diseases aren't a joke in Cuba. Dengue outbreaks happen. Zika was a thing. And with the healthcare system stretched thin, prevention beats treatment every single time. The repellents available locally? Often expired, diluted, or just not effective against the local mosquito population that's built up resistance over decades.</p>\n    <p>Here's what most people get wrong: they send one bottle and call it a day. But a single 4-ounce spray lasts maybe two weeks with daily use. If you're sending protection that actually matters, you need to think bulk—and you need to think about both body sprays AND clothing treatments. The combination approach is what serious travelers and military personnel use, and it's what your family deserves.</p>\n    <p>The other thing? Not all repellents are created equal. DEET is the gold standard for skin application—98% DEET will stop anything with wings. Permethrin is the secret weapon for clothes and gear (it actually kills mosquitoes on contact). And Picaridin is the newer option that works almost as well as DEET without the plastic-melting side effects. Let's break down what's actually worth your money.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-sunglow/10 border-2 border-sunglow p-6 rounded-xl my-8\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-2\">The Quick Answer</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">For maximum protection in Cuban conditions, pair <strong>Repel 100</strong> (98% DEET) for skin with <strong>Sawyer Permethrin</strong> for clothing. The Repel handles the body, the Sawyer makes clothes mosquito-proof for up to 6 weeks—even through washes. This combo is what Peace Corps volunteers use in tropical zones.</p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H89KFC?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">See Repel 100 on Amazon</a>\n  </div>\n\n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">Body Sprays: The Heavy Hitters</h2>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"md:w-1/3\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LXfxfWwyL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel 100 Insect Repellent 4oz - Best Mosquito Repellent for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-48 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"md:w-2/3\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\" data-asin=\"B004H89KFC\">Repel 100 Insect Repellent, 4-Fluid Ounces</h3>\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.6★</span>\n          </div>\n          <span class=\"inline-block bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm mb-3\">$</span>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">This is the nuclear option. 98% DEET means nothing—and I mean nothing—is biting through this. Ten hours of protection in a pump spray that won't leak in transit. The 4oz size is perfect for shipping: substantial enough to last, light enough to not kill your shipping costs.</p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">One caveat: DEET at this concentration can damage plastics and synthetic fabrics. Tell your family to keep it away from watch faces, sunglasses, and that one good shirt. Apply to skin only.</p>\n          <p class=\"font-semibold text-flame dark:text-sunglow\">VERDICT: The best skin protection money can buy. Period.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H89KFC?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-5 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-medium no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"md:w-1/3\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HAn5L7DpL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel 100 Travel Size 1oz - Compact Mosquito Protection\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-48 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"md:w-2/3\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\" data-asin=\"B000LGN3Z2\">Repel 100 Travel Size, 1 fl Ounce</h3>\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.6★</span>\n          </div>\n          <span class=\"inline-block bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm mb-3\">$</span>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Same 98% DEET formula, pocket-sized. These are clutch for throwing into a package when you've already maxed out weight. Your family can keep one in a purse, one by the door, one at work. The pump mechanism is solid—no leaking during the journey.</p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">Smart move: buy several of these instead of one big bottle. Easier to distribute among family members, and if one gets lost, they're not completely unprotected.</p>\n          <p class=\"font-semibold text-flame dark:text-sunglow\">VERDICT: Perfect for padding out a shipment or gifting to multiple people.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LGN3Z2?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-5 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-medium no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"md:w-1/3\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mXT4opT0L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Ben's 100 DEET Repellent 2-Pack - Alcohol-Free Formula\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-48 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"md:w-2/3\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\" data-asin=\"B0738NCJMH\">Ben's 100 Tick & Insect Repellent (2 Pack)</h3>\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.5★</span>\n          </div>\n          <span class=\"inline-block bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm mb-3\">$$</span>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Here's the thing about Ben's: it's alcohol-free. That matters in Cuba's heat. Regular DEET sprays can feel like you're coating yourself in rubbing alcohol—not fun when it's 35°C and humid. Ben's goes on smoother and doesn't evaporate as fast, which means the protection lasts longer in practice.</p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">The 2-pack at $$ tier is smart economics. You're getting 6.8oz total of the good stuff, and the pump bottles are sturdy enough for Cuban conditions.</p>\n          <p class=\"font-semibold text-flame dark:text-sunglow\">VERDICT: Best for people with sensitive skin or who hate that alcohol sting.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0738NCJMH?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-5 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-medium no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n  </section>\n\n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">The Natural Alternative (That Actually Works)</h2>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"md:w-1/3\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71SHlcE8oqL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel Lemon Eucalyptus 2-Pack - Plant-Based Mosquito Repellent\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-48 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"md:w-2/3\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\" data-asin=\"B010AFV1LQ\">Repel Plant-Based Lemon Eucalyptus (Pack of 2)</h3>\n            <span class=\"bg-sunglow text-raisin px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.4★</span>\n          </div>\n          <span class=\"inline-block bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm mb-3\">$</span>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">For the family members who refuse to put \"chemicals\" on their skin—and look, I get it—this is the only natural option the CDC actually recommends. Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE) provides about 6 hours of protection. Not as long as DEET, but genuinely effective.</p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">The 2-pack at budget pricing makes this easy to include. Smells pleasant too, which matters when you're reapplying multiple times a day. Just don't use it on kids under 3—that's the one restriction.</p>\n          <p class=\"font-semibold text-flame dark:text-sunglow\">VERDICT: The real deal for DEET-avoiders. Not a gimmick.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010AFV1LQ?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"mt-4 inline-block px-5 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-medium no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n\n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">Picaridin: The Modern DEET Alternative</h2>\n    \n    <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-6\">Picaridin is what the Europeans have been using for years while Americans stuck with DEET. It's odorless, doesn't damage plastics or fabrics, and works nearly as well. If your family hates the feel of DEET but needs serious protection, this is the move.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg\">\n        <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nf8TQw98L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Picaridin Lotion - Gentle Mosquito Protection\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-48 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700 mb-4\">\n        <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n          <h3 class=\"text-lg font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white\" data-asin=\"B00VV5KRD8\">Sawyer Picaridin Lotion, 4oz</h3>\n          <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-medium\">4.5★</span>\n        </div>\n        <span class=\"inline-block bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm mb-3\">$</span>\n        <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">Lotion format means precise application and zero waste.
