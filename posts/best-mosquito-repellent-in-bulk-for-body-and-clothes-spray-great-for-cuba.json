They're aggressive, they're persistent, and with dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases being real concerns, this isn't about comfort. It's about keeping your family healthy. The good news? You can send serious protection in bulk without blowing your shipping budget. Let me walk you through what actually works and what's worth the suitcase space.\n    </p>\n  </header>\n\n  <section class=\"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-8\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4\">Why This Matters More Than You Think</h2>\n    <p>\n      Here's the thing about mosquito repellent in Cuba: it's either unavailable, crazy expensive, or those weak formulas that mosquitoes basically laugh at. The stuff you can buy in any CVS here? That's gold over there. And when you're sending a package, you want products that pack the most protection per ounce—because every gram counts against shipping costs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You've got three main approaches: DEET-based sprays for skin (the nuclear option), Picaridin formulas (gentler but still effective), and Permethrin for treating clothes and gear (mosquitoes die on contact). The smart move? Send a combination. Different situations call for different solutions, and your family will thank you for thinking it through.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One more thing—humidity. Cuba's tropical climate means whatever you send needs to work when it's 90% humidity and your skin is already sweating. Cheap stuff washes right off. These don't.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  <aside class=\"bg-sunglow/10 border-2 border-sunglow p-6 rounded-xl my-8\">\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-2\">The Quick Answer</h3>\n    <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">\n      If you can only send one thing, make it the <strong>Sawyer Permethrin 24oz bottle</strong>—it treats multiple sets of clothes, lasts through 6 washes per treatment, and mosquitoes literally die when they land on treated fabric. Pair it with <strong>Repel 100</strong> for skin protection and you've covered all bases.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANQVYU?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">See Best Overall Pick →</a>\n  </aside>\n\n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">For Treating Clothes & Gear (The Smart Play)</h2>\n    \n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BgXKIOvzL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Products Premium Permethrin 24oz - Best Mosquito Repellent in Bulk for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.6★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\" data-asin=\"B001ANQVYU\">Sawyer Permethrin 24oz — Best Value for Bulk</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">\n            This is the one. Twenty-four ounces treats roughly 4-5 complete outfits, and each treatment survives 6 weeks or 6 washes. Your family sprays their work clothes, their outdoor gear, even mosquito nets—and mosquitoes that land on the fabric? They're done. Dead. Not deterred, <em>dead</em>. The bottle's a bit heavy for shipping, but the coverage per dollar is unbeatable.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-semibold\">VERDICT: The bulk buy that actually makes sense. One bottle protects the whole family for months.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANQVYU?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"inline-block mt-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81drsTLaouL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Permethrin Large Size - Mosquito Repellent for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.6★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$$$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\" data-asin=\"B07CD9NFB4\">Sawyer Permethrin (Larger Size) — For Extended Families</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">\n            Same excellent formula, bigger bottle. If you're supplying multiple households or want to make sure there's enough to treat bedding, curtains, and outdoor furniture too, this is the move. The per-ounce cost drops, and in Cuba, having extra to share with neighbors builds community goodwill. You know how it is.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-semibold\">VERDICT: Go big if you're sending to more than one family or want serious stockpile protection.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CD9NFB4?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"inline-block mt-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61-sPgzpE7L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Sawyer Permethrin Small Size - Travel Mosquito Repellent\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.6★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\" data-asin=\"B001ANQVZE\">Sawyer Permethrin (Smaller Size) — Starter or Travel</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">\n            Perfect if you're tight on shipping space or want to include it as part of a care package with other essentials. Treats 1-2 outfits thoroughly. I'd grab a couple of these to toss in with other supplies rather than making it the main event—unless you're just testing to see if your family likes the approach before sending the big bottle.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-semibold\">VERDICT: Great add-on, but for real bulk protection, go with the 24oz.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANQVZE?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"inline-block mt-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n\n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">For Skin: Maximum Strength DEET</h2>\n    \n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61LXfxfWwyL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel 100 Insect Repellent 4oz - Best DEET for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.6★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\" data-asin=\"B004H89KFC\">Repel 100 (4oz Pump) — The Heavy Artillery</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">\n            98% DEET. That's not a typo. This is what the CDC recommends for areas with serious mosquito-borne disease risk. Ten hours of protection means one application covers an entire evening outside. It's strong stuff—you wouldn't use this daily for years—but for high-risk situations, fishing trips, or outdoor work during peak mosquito hours? Nothing beats it.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-semibold\">VERDICT: Keep this for when the mosquitoes are really bad. Worth every penny of shipping cost.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004H89KFC?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"inline-block mt-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HAn5L7DpL._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Repel 100 Travel Size 1oz - Mosquito Repellent for Cuba\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.6★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\" data-asin=\"B000LGN3Z2\">Repel 100 (1oz Pump) — Pocket Protection</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">\n            Same 98% DEET formula in a pocket-sized bottle. Brilliant for tucking into a purse or keeping in the guagua for unexpected outdoor situations. I'd send several of these—they're light, cheap, and your family can distribute them to whoever needs one. The small size also makes customs less likely to question it.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-semibold\">VERDICT: Buy 4-5 and scatter them throughout the package. Lightweight, powerful, practical.</p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LGN3Z2?tag=veguitas-20\" class=\"inline-block mt-4 px-6 py-2 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">Check Price on Amazon</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-56 flex-shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mXT4opT0L._AC_UL320_.jpg\" alt=\"Ben's 100 DEET 2-Pack - Alcohol-Free Mosquito Repellent\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.5★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">$$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\" data-asin=\"B0738NCJMH\">Ben's 100 (2-Pack) — Alcohol-Free Option</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-3\">\n            Here's the difference: Ben's is alcohol-free, which matters if someone has sensitive skin or you're worried about the formula affecting plastics (watch bands, sunglasses, etc.).
