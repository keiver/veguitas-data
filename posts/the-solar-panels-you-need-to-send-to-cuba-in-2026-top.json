Now What?</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed opacity-95\">\n      If you've spent the last year watching your family in Cuba navigate 12-hour blackouts with nothing but candles and a dying phone battery, you already know why you're here. Solar isn't a luxury anymore—it's the difference between your abuela having a working fan at night or suffering through another sweltering apagón. The good news? Prices have dropped. The tricky part? Picking panels that'll actually survive the humidity, ship without getting destroyed, and work with Cuba's electrical chaos. Let's figure this out together.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-10\">\n    <p>\n      Here's what nobody tells you about sending solar panels to Cuba: wattage isn't everything. Sure, a 400W system sounds impressive, but if it weighs 80 pounds and your shipping agency charges by the pound, you've just spent more on freight than the panels themselves. And then there's the question of <strong>what your family actually needs</strong>—running a small refrigerator during outages is a different beast than keeping phones charged and a couple of LED lights on.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The panels I'm recommending here all share a few non-negotiables: monocrystalline cells (better efficiency in Cuba's intense sun), reasonable weight-to-wattage ratios, and included charge controllers so your family isn't hunting for parts in Havana. Some are rigid panels meant for permanent rooftop installation; others fold up and can be tucked away when the inspectors come around. Both have their place depending on your family's situation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One more thing—voltage matters less than you'd think with solar. These panels output DC power that goes through a charge controller to batteries, so the 110V/220V debate doesn't apply here. What <em>does</em> matter is having a quality inverter on the Cuba side, but that's a separate purchase. Today, we're just getting sunlight into batteries.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"bg-sunglow/10 border-2 border-sunglow p-5 md:p-8 rounded-xl my-8\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-raisin dark:text-white mb-3\">The Quick Answer</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 text-lg mb-4\">\n      For most families dealing with Cuban blackouts, the <strong>ECO-WORTHY 200W Kit</strong> hits the sweet spot—enough power to run essentials, includes everything needed to start, and the brand has a solid track record. If you can swing the shipping costs and your family has roof space, the 400W options give serious independence.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RZZHHHM?tag=veguitas-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold no-underline hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors\">\n      See the ECO-WORTHY 200W Kit →\n    </a>\n  </section>\n\n  \n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-5 md:p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-xl mb-8 ring-2 ring-lime ring-offset-2 dark:ring-offset-slate-900\">\n      <span class=\"bg-lime text-raisin px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-bold uppercase mb-4 inline-block\">Editor's Pick</span>\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-full md:w-64 shrink-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Ps3BsTkML._AC_UY218_.jpg\" alt=\"ECO-WORTHY 200W Solar Panel Kit - Best overall for Cuba\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"rounded-xl w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1 min-w-0\">\n          <h3 class=\"text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-2\" data-asin=\"B09RZZHHHM\">ECO-WORTHY 200W Solar Panel Kit</h3>\n          <div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center gap-3 mb-4\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.6★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">465 reviews</span>\n            <span class=\"text-flame font-semibold\">$$$$$</span>\n          </div>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">\n            This is the one I'd send to my own family.

The monocrystalline cells handle partial shade better than cheaper alternatives, and at 200W total, you're looking at enough juice to keep a small fridge running during daytime outages or charge multiple devices simultaneously.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4\">\n            <strong>VERDICT:</strong> The complete package.
