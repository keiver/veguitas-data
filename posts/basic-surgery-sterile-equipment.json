Really scarce. If you've got family working in healthcare—or honestly, just family who might need stitches someday—sending sterile surgical supplies isn't paranoid. It's practical. The trick is knowing what's worth the shipping cost, what customs will actually let through, and what your tía can realistically use without specialized training. Let's figure this out together.\n    </p>\n  </header>\n\n  <!-- Context Section -->\n  <section class=\"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none mb-8\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-4\">What You're Actually Dealing With</h2>\n    \n    <p>\n      Surgical supplies fall into a weird category for Cuba-bound packages. On one hand, they're genuinely needed—hospitals and clinics are constantly short on basics like sutures, sterile gauze, even cotton applicators. On the other hand, you're not shipping scalpels to your cousin who works at a bodega. You need to think about who's receiving this and what they can actually do with it.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n      The good news? Most of what we're covering here is first-aid adjacent. Suture kits, wound care supplies, sterile applicators—stuff that a nurse, paramedic, or even someone with basic training can use safely. The premium surgical packs are really for healthcare workers with proper facilities. Don't send a full surgical pack to someone who just wanted some butterfly bandages.\n    </p>\n    \n    <p>\n      Weight matters more than you'd think. Suture kits are surprisingly light, but gauze rolls and surgical packs add up fast. I'll flag the shipping-friendly options as we go.\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  <!-- Quick Answer Box -->\n  <aside class=\"bg-sunglow/10 border-2 border-sunglow p-6 rounded-xl my-8\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-2\">The Quick Answer</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4\">\n      For most families, the <strong>Sterile Sutures Thread 28-Piece Kit ($$)</strong> hits the sweet spot—comprehensive enough to handle real emergencies, light enough to ship affordably, and priced so you can send multiple kits. Healthcare workers? Consider the 47-unit or 49-piece professional kits for serious coverage.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CQSJKV5?tag=veguitas-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"inline-block px-6 py-3 rounded-full bg-flame text-white font-semibold hover:bg-flame/90 transition-colors no-underline\">See the 28-Piece Kit on Amazon</a>\n  </aside>\n\n  <!-- Product Section: Suture Kits -->\n  <section class=\"mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-6\">Suture Kits: Where the Real Value Is</h2>\n    \n    <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 mb-6\">\n      These are the workhorses. A good suture kit can close wounds that would otherwise get infected waiting for hospital supplies. Let's break down your options from practical to professional.\n    </p>\n\n    <!-- Product 1: Basic Suture Kit -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-6\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6\">\n        <div class=\"w-48 md:w-56 flex-shrink-0 mx-auto md:mx-0\">\n          <img src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lwz8M6r1L._AC_UY218_.jpg\" alt=\"Sterile Sutures Thread with Needle Plus Tools 28-Piece Kit - Basic Surgery Sterile Equipment\" class=\"rounded-lg w-full h-64 object-contain bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-700\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"flex-1\">\n          <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3 mb-2\">\n            <span class=\"bg-lime text-white px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm font-semibold\">4.7★</span>\n            <span class=\"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm\">475 reviews</span>\n            <span class=\"bg-slate-200 dark:bg-slate-700 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300 px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm\">$$</span>\n          </div>\n          <h3 data-asin=\"B07CQSJKV5\" class=\"text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white mb-3\">Sterile Sutures Thread with Needle Plus Tools (28 Pieces)</h3>\n          <p class=\"text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-400 mb-3\">\n            This is the one I recommend most often. 16 mixed sutures (0, 2/0, 3/0, 4/0) plus 12 instruments—needle holders, forceps, scissors, the works. Light enough that shipping won't kill you, comprehensive enough to handle most wound closures.

Dissolvable for internal or hard-to-reach areas, non-dissolvable for skin closures that need removal. If you're sending to a nurse or doctor, this is the upgrade worth paying for.

Those finer sutures are for delicate work—facial wounds, areas where scarring matters. Most kits stop at 4-0. If you're sending to someone who does any kind of cosmetic or facial repair, this wider range is genuinely useful.
